Microbial Metabolic Interactions
================================

**MMinte** (pronounced /â€˜minti/) is a set of widgets that allows you to explore
the pairwise interactions (positive or negative) that occur in a microbial
community. From an association network and 16S rDNA sequence data, **MMinte**
identifies corresponding genomes, reconstructs metabolic models, estimates
growth under specific metabolic conditions, analyzes pairwise interactions,
assigns interaction types to network links, and generates the corresponding
network of interactions.

Installation
------------

Use pip to install **MMinte** from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mminte>`_
(we recommend doing this inside a `virtual environment
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_)::

    pip install mminte
