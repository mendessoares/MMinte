Microbial Metabolic Interactions
================================

**MMinte** (pronounced /â€˜minti/) is a set of widgets that allows you to explore
the pairwise interactions (positive or negative) that occur in a microbial
community. From an association network and 16S rDNA sequence data, **MMinte**
identifies corresponding genomes, reconstructs metabolic models, estimates
growth under specific metabolic conditions, analyzes pairwise interactions,
assigns interaction types to network links, and generates the corresponding
network of interactions.

Installation
------------

Use pip to install **MMinte** from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mminte>`_
(we recommend doing this inside a `virtual environment
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_)::

    pip install mminte

Note that **MMinte** requires cobrapy 0.5.11. Python versions 2.7.11+, Python 3.5+,
or Python 3.6+ are recommended.

Virtual environment installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are step-by-step instructions for installing **MMinte** in a virtual environment.

1. If virtualenvwrapper is not installed, `follow the directions <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
   to install virtualenvwrapper.

2. Create a virtualenv for **MMinte** with these commands::

    $ mkvirtualenv --python python2 mminte-py27

   Use the ``--python`` option to select a specific version of Python for the virtualenv. For example,
   ``python=python3`` to select the current python3 installed on the system.

   Note on macOS, matplotlib requires Python be installed as a framework but virtualenv creates a
   non-framework build of Python. See the `matplotlib FAQ <http://matplotlib.org/1.5.3/faq/virtualenv_faq.html>`__
   for details on a workaround.

3. Upgrade pip and setuptools to the latest versions with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

4. Install the base **MMinte** package with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ pip install mmminte

5. If you want to verify the installation with the included tests, install the test dependencies and run
   the tests with these commands::

    (mminte-py27) pip install mminte[test]
    (mminte-py27) pytest mminte -v

How to run an analysis with MMinte
----------------------------------

There are two ways to run an analysis with **MMinte**.

In a notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A tutorial of how to use **MMinte** is provided in a Jupyter notebook. Here's how to
start Jupyter and run the notebook from the virtual environment.

1. Install Jupyter with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ pip install jupyter

2. Install a kernel that uses the virtualenv installation with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ ipython kernel install --name "MMinte_Python27" --user

3. Start the Jupyter notebook server with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ jupyter notebook

   Jupyter opens a web page in your default browser with a file browser.

4. Navigate to the "documentation_builder" folder and click on the "tutorial.ipynb" notebook.

5. After the notebook opens, from the "Kernel" menu, select "Change kernel" and click on "MMinte_Python27".

6. Now you can run the cells in the notebook.

In a web browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MMinte** includes a web site that allows you to run each widget from a web browser.
The web site runs on your local system and requires that you use a folder on the
local system for storing the results of the analysis. Here's how to start the web site:

1. Install the additional packages needed for the web site interface with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ pip install mminte[site]

2. Start the web server with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ launchMMinte
    Logging to "/var/folders/pz/r04ddhtx6vgb48tg0dn5cys8vz00jn/T" folder
    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Listening for SIGHUP.
    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Listening for SIGTERM.
    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Listening for SIGUSR1.
    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Bus STARTING
    CherryPy Checker:
    The Application mounted at '' has an empty config.

    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Started monitor thread 'Autoreloader'.
    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Started monitor thread '_TimeoutMonitor'.
    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8080
    [14/Apr/2017:14:25:04] ENGINE Bus STARTED

   When you see the ``ENGINE Bus STARTED`` message, the web server is ready.

3. If another service is using port 8080, you can start the web server on a different
   port with this command::

    (mminte-py27)$ launchMMinte --port 8099

4. Open a web browser and go to ``http://localhost:8080`` (change the port number
   if you started the web server on a different port) and follow the directions to
   run your analysis.

Release Notes
